# Edge-powered-Skin-Disease-Classification-and-Anomaly-Detection-with-GAN
DERM-AI: Edge-Powered Skin Disease Classification & Anomaly Detection  DERM-AI is a next-generation edge-computing, semi-supervised AI system that turns smartphones into intelligent diagnostic assistants for skin health. Built with MobileNetV2 and a GAN-based anomaly detection pipeline, it empowers users to get reliable, privacy-preserving dermatological insights — even in areas with no internet connectivity.  ⚙️ Key Features  📊 99% Classification Accuracy – Optimized MobileNetV2 architecture for four common conditions: Acne, Ringworm, Nail Fungus, Athlete’s Foot.  🤖 GAN-based Anomaly Detection – Flags unknown or rare conditions with a 75.7% F1-score for early intervention.  📱 Edge Deployment – INT8 quantization reduces model size by 90%, enabling real-time offline predictions.  🔒 Privacy-First – All processing happens on-device with secure authentication.  🌐 Cross-Platform – Built with Flutter + TFLite for Android (iOS support planned).  🌍 Why It Matters  Millions lack access to dermatologists. DERM-AI bridges the gap by providing:  📌 Early detection of common and emerging skin conditions  🚑 Decision support for rural clinics and underserved communities  🔬 Adaptive learning to keep up with evolving health trends  🚀 Vision  DERM-AI lays the groundwork for AI-driven point-of-care diagnostics across multiple medical domains — pushing healthcare accessibility to a global scale.  🛠️ Tech Stack  Machine Learning: Python, TensorFlow, MobileNetV2, GANomaly, Scikit-learn  Edge AI: TFLite (INT8 Quantization)  Visualization: NumPy, Matplotlib  Mobile App: Flutter, Dart, Android Studio
